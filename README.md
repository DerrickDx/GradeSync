# GradeSync
An application for synchronizing student grades from external resources to MyUni


This project aims to provide our teaching staff with a productive way to pull student grades from external sources like Web Submission by building an application using Node.js as required. Users need to provide their Canvas access tokens generated on MyUni which to determine the courses and assignments to be displayed in the dynamic multi-level dropdown menu, then select the assignment from Web Submission and the corresponding assignment from MyUni to synchronize the grades. At the current stage, only virtual machine image of Web Submission is used due to security measures.
